          <p>Are you tired? Human? Love stuff but not some other stuff? Stay up til 8am working on Tic Tac Toe to find out no one can really play it but you? Well, you're in luck! </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Yes, we realize we haven't made a point. But you're still reading this. Aren't you?</li><br>
              <li>I know what you're thinking.</li><br>
              <li>Do you like fish sticks?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So what are you waiting for? Pick a partner and get playing! Just not on this game. Because it doesn't work. Instead, get up, dance, stretch, make some new friends, talk to old friends, give someone a hug. Do anything but play this unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game...unless you're "X"</p> -->
